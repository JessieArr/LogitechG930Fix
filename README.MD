# LogitechG930Fix

I've seen many people complaining about the fact that their Logitech G930 headset turns off for them every 15 minutes when using the Logitech Gaming Software, and it has been a frustration for me as well.

So, I wrote this simple program to help. It is a small Windows application which will help you view and modify the battery settings for your G930 headset used by the Logitech Gaming Software.

It checks a couple default installation locations automatically, but if it can't find the configuration file in those locations, you can manually select it from a file browser window within the application.

You can download and modify the source if you choose, or simply head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/JessieArr/LogitechG930Fix/releases) to download a compiled executable if you trust me. :)
